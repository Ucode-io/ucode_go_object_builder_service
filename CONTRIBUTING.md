## Contributing to ucode_go_object_builder_service

Thanks for your interest in helping out! This project is open-source and community friendly. These guidelines explain how we work together so everyone can contribute effectively.

### Getting Started

- Review the `README.md` to understand the architecture, tooling, and workflow.
- Install dependencies and make sure you can run the project locally.
- Pick an issue or propose a new idea — please discuss significant changes in an issue before opening a pull request (PR).

### Development Workflow

1. **Fork & clone** the repository.
2. **Create a branch** for your work, e.g. `feature/add-widget`.
3. **Write clear code and tests**. Favor small, well-scoped changes.
4. **Run tests and linters** before opening a PR.

### Commit & PR Guidelines

- Use clear, imperative commit messages (e.g. `Add validation for Foo`).
- Reference related issues in the PR description.
- Explain the motivation, approach, and any tradeoffs.
- Include screenshots or logs for UI or behavior changes when helpful.
- Mark PRs as “draft” if you still need feedback before they’re ready.

### Code Style & Quality

- Follow the existing code style; when in doubt, match what you see nearby.
- Add or update tests for any behavior change.
- Keep dependencies minimal and justify new ones.

### Reviews & Feedback

- Maintain a friendly, constructive tone when reviewing.
- Address review comments promptly; reply with how you resolved feedback.
- If you disagree with feedback, explain your reasoning and seek consensus.

### Reporting Issues & Bugs

- Search existing issues first.
- Provide reproduction steps, expected vs actual behavior, logs, and environment details.
- Use the issue templates if available.

### Security

- Please do **not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.
- Instead, email `security@ucode.dev` with details so we can coordinate a fix.

### Community Expectations

- Treat everyone respectfully and follow the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
- When in doubt, ask questions — maintainers are here to help.
